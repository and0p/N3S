To compile (for now) you must also link msvc-2010.dll from Nestopia libretro fork in my projects.

The HoloLens port is not currently being updated and was left in a bit of disarray, since I no longer have a HoloLens to test with. Fortunately, @toolboc cleaned it up and added Xbox One S controller support (so you can actually control the games now!). Please clone his repo and follow the instructions at https://github.com/toolboc/NesVoxel
